        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This scrambled eggs recipe will list out all the required 
            ingredients along with step by step instructions to complete 
            the recipe. </p>
        <p>The result should be a nice soft and fluffy scrambled egg,
            as depicted in the picture above.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 table spoons of half & half</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>BEAT HARD: Set out a mixing bowl. Crack the eggs into
                 the mixing bowl and make sure that there's no eggshell
                  in the bowl. Add the half-and-half to the bowl. Use a
                   hand crank eggbeater or a whisk to beat the eggs
                    vigorously until light and frothy
            </li>
            <li>LOW HEAT: Set a small nonstick skillet over low heat.
                 Place the butter in the skillet and allow it to melt.
            </li>
            <li>Once the butter has fully melted, whisk the eggs again 
                to make sure they are as frothy as possible when going
                 into the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                LIFT THE PAN: Lift the pan off the heat and swirl the
                 butter around the pan. Pour the frothy eggs into the
                  skillet while the pan is lifted, so that its first
                   contact with heat is very gentle.
            </li>
            <li>
                MOVE TO THE CENTER: Set the pan back on the burner and
                 use a rubber spatula to gently move the eggs towards
                  the center of the pan. Do this in a circular pattern,
                   from the outer edge of the pan to the center, the
                    entire time the eggs are cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                UNDERCOOK: Once the eggs are 85% cooked, turn off the
                 heat. Salt and pepper the eggs, gently stir again, and
                  move them to a plate while they still look slightly
                   undercooked, about 90% cooked. The eggs will continue
                    to cook as they sit on the plate. If they look fully
                     cooked while they're in the pan they will be a bit
                      more rubbery on the plate. Taking them off the
                       heat while they still look wet will ensure your
                        eggs are perfectly soft on the plate.
