            <li>12 ounces penne pasta</li>
            <li>8 ounces ground beef chunk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (1 minced, 2 sliced)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds beefsteak tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Freshly grounjd pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the 
                pasta and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup 
                cooking water, then drain.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix the beef, 1/4 cup parmesan, the 
                breadcrumbs, egg, 1/2 cup basil, the minced garlic and 
                1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl with your hands until 
                just combined. Form into 3/4-inch meatballs (about 20). 
                Grate the tomatoes into a medium bowl; discard the skins.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the 
                olive oil, then the meatballs. Cook, turning, until 
                browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sliced 
                garlic and cook until just golden, about 1 minute. 
                Gradually add the vodka, then the grated tomatoes and 
                cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce 
                thickens and the meatballs are cooked through, 8 to 10 
                minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds 
                of pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the pasta and the remaining 1/4 cup basil to the 
                skillet; toss, adding the reserved cooking water as 
                needed to loosen. Remove from the heat and add the 
                remaining 1/2 cup parmesan; toss.
            </li>
        </ol>
